## Mockups

Hi there, I added here my final proposal version of the mockups. To do it I used Figma as my design tool.

I'm sharing with you a local version of the file or you can also visit the web version in the following link:

The mockups also have a quick prototyping, so you can navigate through the mobile and desktop version:
